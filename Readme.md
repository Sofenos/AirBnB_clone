# AirBnB Clone Project

This project is an implementation of a simplified version of the Airbnb website, including a command-line interface to manage AirBnB objects. The goal is to cover fundamental concepts of higher-level programming, including data modeling, serialization, and creating a command interpreter.

## Command Interpreter

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.

### How to Use

1. Launch the command interpreter by running `./console.py`.
2. You will see the prompt `(hbnb)` indicating the command interpreter is active.
3. Enter commands to interact with the AirBnB objects.
